This project focuses on identifying diseases in medicinal plants using deep learning techniques. A diverse image dataset of diseased and healthy plant leaves is collected, preprocessed (resized and normalized), and split into training, validation, and test sets.

Multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, including InceptionV3, VGG-16, and VGG-19, are evaluated. The best-performing model is selected based on validation accuracy and other performance metrics. Transfer learning is used to fine-tune the selected model for optimal results.

The final model is tested on unseen data and evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
